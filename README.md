# ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System

A **machine learning-based web application** that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. This system helps farmers and agricultural experts make data-driven decisions to improve productivity.

##  Dataset

This project utilizes the **Crop Recommendation Dataset** available on Kaggle, curated by Varshita Nalluri:

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  

Dataset: [**Crop Recommendation Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varshitanalluri/crop-recommendation-dataset)  

- **Description**: The dataset contains records of seven key environmental and soil featuresâ€”Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH Value, and Rainfallâ€”paired with the most suitable crop for given conditions.

##  How it Works

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Loaded the dataset from CSV.  
   - Explored data characteristics via `head`, `shape`, `info`, checks for missing or duplicate values, basic statistics, and a correlation heatmap.

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Mapped crop names to numeric labels.  
   - Split data into features (`X`) and target (`y`), followed by an 80/20 train-test split.  
   - Scaled numeric features using **MinMaxScaler**.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained a range of classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Extra Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.  
   - Evaluated accuracy scores on the test set and selected **Random Forest Classifier** as the best-performing model.

4. **Model Serialization**  
   - Persisted the trained model and scaler using **pickle** to `model.pkl` and `minmaxscaler.pkl`.

5. **Web Application with Flask**  
   - Built a simple Flask app to accept form inputs for soil and environmental parameters, preprocess them, run the model, and render crop recommendations in real time.
